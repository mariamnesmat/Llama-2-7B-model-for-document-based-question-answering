# Llama-2-7B-model-for-document-based-question-answering
This project employs the LangChain library to construct a robust document-based question-answering (QA) system. By loading content from diverse URLs, such as chapters from a deep learning book, the system preprocesses and organizes the information. Utilizing the Hugging Face model, the text undergoes embedding to capture semantic nuances effectively. FAISS serves as the vector store, optimizing the indexing and retrieval of document embeddings. The integration of the CTransformers wrapper with the Llama-2-7B-Chat model facilitates a powerful QA mechanism. The system is configured to efficiently handle user queries, providing accurate answers alongside source documents.
